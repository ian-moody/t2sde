[I] A secure HTTP/HTTPS filtering proxy

[T] Ffproxy is a filtering HTTP/HTTPS proxy server. It is able to filter
[T] by host, URL, and header. Custom header entries can be filtered and
[T] added. It can even drop its privileges and optionally chroot() to some
[T] directory. Logging to syslog() is supported, as is using another auxiliary
[T] proxy server. An HTTP accelerator feature (acting as a front-end to an
[T] HTTP server) is included. Contacting IPv6 servers as well as binding
[T] to IPv6 is supported and allows transparent IPv6 over IPv4 browsing
[T] (and vice versa).
