[I] Accessing chipdrives

[T] This library is a basic framework for accessing chip cards via chip card
[T] readers (terminals). It uses the CTAPI interface which is supported by
[T] most card readers (like Towitoko, Kobil), so it should work with many of them.
[T] Since version 0.6 libchipcard can also access readers via the PC/SC (MUSCLE)
[T] interface
