[I] SELinux policy core utilities

[T] Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux® kernel and a number
[T] of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
[T] mandatory access controls to Linux. The Security-enhanced Linux
[T] kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
[T] improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
[T] architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
[T] of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
[T] based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
[T] Control, and Multi-level Security.
[T] policycoreutils contains the policy core utilities that are required
[T] for basic operation of a SELinux system. These utilities include
[T] load_policy to load policies, setfiles to label filesystems, newrole
[T] to switch roles, and run_init to run /etc/init.d scripts in the proper
[T] context.
